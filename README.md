This project is the creation of a weather app that calls https://openweathermap.org/api to get the current weather data for a location.

Personal Notes for me:
What I Learned:
- Asynchronous programming in js - async/await and using promises when fetching api information
- How important mobile first design is - I used figma to originally create the blueprints for designing the weather app, and it was really easy to move all the elements after adding them first in mobile
- Better code organization and conventions - a big reason why I struggled so much in my earlier project (To-Do List) was because I didn't plan how to structure the code before I wrote any code. I'm never doing that again.

What I Struggled With:
- Time management - I expected myself to finish this project in 2-3 days, and it ended up taking more than a week because I didn't set aside dedicated blocks of time to work on this project. I would go to sleep after work --> work on this for 20-30 minutes --> go to sleep again. When coding projects, I shouldn't sleep immediately after work.
- Pushing to github pages - My foundations in webpack and REGEX aren't that strong, and I want to improve on them before starting my next big project. I spent a long time googling how to push my project on Github pages because a lot of assets didn't render, but I could've saved a lot of time by gaining a solid foundation on loaders.
